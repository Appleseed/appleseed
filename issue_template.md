### Feature requests and proposals
We're trying our best to make Appleseed Portal better but a community, more often than not, can come up with better ideas 
than a small core team. Please let us know what feature you'd like to add in as much detail as possible.

### Bugs
If you're filing an issue about a bug please include as much information
as you can including the following.

- Your browser and the version: (e.x. Chrome 56.0, Firefox 52.0, IE 10)
- Your operating system: (e.x. OS X 10, Windows 8, Ubuntu, etc)
- Appleseed Portal Version: (e.x. 1.3)

- *Repeatable steps to reproduce the issue*

Thank you for your time and helping us make this project better!
